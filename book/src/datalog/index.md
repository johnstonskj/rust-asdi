# Datalog

When referring to the specifics of the language we will use the common format $\text{\small{Datalog}}$ with
superscripts that identify specific language extensions; for example, $\small\text{Datalog}^{\lnot}$ is
the language extended with negation of literals, $\small\text{Datalog}^{\Gamma}$ is the language
extended with type checking on attributes, and $\small\text{Datalog}^{\lnot,\theta}$ is the language
extended with negation of literals _and_ arithmetic literals. The order of superscript symbols is
irrelevant. Additionally, text in **bold** indicates a key concept in the language while text in
_italics_ indicates a forward reference to such a concept.
