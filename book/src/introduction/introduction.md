# Introduction

Another Simplistic [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog) Implementation (ASDI), in Rust.

This package provides a data model to represent [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog)
programs in memory, a parser for the textual representation, and some evaluation implementations.

Datalog is a logic programming language and a subset of the earlier
[Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog). Chapter 1 of [Logic Programming and
Databases](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-83952-8) provides a good overview of
the drawbacks of Prolog and the advantages of Datalog for certain tasks.
